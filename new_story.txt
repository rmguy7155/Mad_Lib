Title: Family Rock Band
I don't come from your average brainy family. That's
because we're all part of the Guy Family Rock Band
and we lead a very repulsive life. For example, by not shaving
his hydrogen every morning, my dad saves enough time to
practice the fantastic drums. My brother doesn't participate
in after school activities because he plays the electric honey.
My dangerous sister doesn't have any time to play with
weeks because she sings vocals and practices
for four or five hours every hydrogen. When I'm not
writing our naughty songs, I'm tickling the
people on the keyboard, so I don't
have any free time either. Finally, Mom is our enchanting manager.
She books our band to play at weddings, dull sixteens,
and planet parties. Maybe someday, if we practice
often enough, we'll get to make a music video
for O-TV and play sold-out shows at Madison
Square honey!
