Title: Family Rock Band
I don't come from your average (adj) family. That's
because we're all part of the (last_name) Family Rock Band
and we lead a very (adj) life. For example, by not shaving
his (noun) every morning, my dad saves enough time to
practice the (adj) drums. My brother doesn't participate
in after school activities because he plays the electric (noun).
My (adj) sister doesn't have any time to play with
(plural_noun) because she sings vocals and practices
for four or five hours every (noun). When I'm not
writing our (adj) songs, I'm tickling the
(plural_noun) on the keyboard, so I don't
have any free time either. Finally, Mom is our (adj) manager.
She books our band to play at weddings, (adj) sixteens,
and (noun) parties. Maybe someday, if we practice
often enough, we'll get to make a music video
for (letter)-TV and play sold-out shows at Madison
Square (noun)!
